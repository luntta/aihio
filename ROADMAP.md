# AI-First Roadmap

Plan to turn aihio from "a design system that happens to publish a schema" into a true AI-first interface. Sequenced so earlier phases unblock later ones.

Legend: [x] done · [ ] todo · [~] in progress

## Phase 1 — Schema foundation

Everything else reads from the component schema, so the shape is the keystone.

- [x] Design expanded schema format (add `version`, `intents`, `composition`, `a11yContract`, `counterExamples`)
- [x] Author meta-schema at `src/schema/meta-schema.json`
- [x] Curate intent vocabulary at `src/schema/intents.json`
- [x] Ship zero-dep validator at `src/schema/validate.js`
- [x] Update `src/schema/build.js` to validate every component schema, cross-check intents against the vocabulary, fail fast on unknown keywords
- [x] Emit `dist/schema.json` (human) + `dist/schema.min.json` (agent-token-efficient; prose stripped, structure preserved)
- [x] Migrate all 10 component schemas (alert, avatar, badge, button, card, dialog, dropdown, input, tabs, toggle) with real content
- [x] Extend `test/build.test.js` with schema-shape, minified-output, and validator-error coverage

## Phase 2 — Intent tokens

Expose design tokens by meaning so prompts map cleanly. Primitive + semantic stay; add a third intent tier above semantic.

- [x] Author `tokens/intent.json` (e.g. `color.intent.destructive`, `spacing.intent.form-field-gap`, `radius.intent.interactive`)
- [x] Teach `src/tokens/build.js` to compile intent tokens alongside existing tiers
- [x] Migrate component CSS, one component at a time, to consume intent tokens where semantically appropriate (primitive stays only for internal wiring)
- [x] Document the intent vocabulary in a single page agents can read

## Phase 3 — Patterns library

Agents build pages, not isolated buttons. Patterns encode canonical compositions.

- [x] Create top-level `patterns/` with per-pattern folders
- [x] Pattern shape: `pattern.json` (`id`, `name`, `intents`, `description`, `requiredComponents`, `variations`) + `markup.html` + optional `variations/*.html`
- [x] Seed ~8 patterns: auth form, settings section, empty state, destructive confirmation, data card grid, tabbed settings, inline form with validation, toast-style alert stack
- [x] Merge patterns into `dist/schema.json` under a `patterns` key
- [x] Reference components by intent (not name) inside patterns where possible
- [x] Build-time validation that every `requiredComponents` entry exists in the schema

## Phase 4 — Runtime introspection + versioning

Let live DOM reason about itself; warn authors in dev when they violate the schema.

- [x] Ship `Aihio.describe(tag)` returning the schema entry for a live element (bundle minified schema into the JS entry or lazy-fetch, decide by bundle-size budget)
- [x] Per-component `static schemaVersion` field matching the schema's `version`
- [x] Dev-build console warnings when attributes violate the schema (invalid enum values, missing required a11y)
- [x] Warning for `aihio-dialog` with no `aihio-dialog-title` and no `aria-label` on the host
- [x] Warning for `aihio-input` with no associated `<label>` / `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby`

## Phase 5 — Types from schema

One source of truth for API surface; TypeScript editors get validation for free.

- [x] Codegen step in `src/schema/build.js` that emits `dist/aihio.d.ts`
- [x] Per-component attribute types + JSX intrinsic element augmentations
- [x] Exported union types for intents and variants
- [x] Add `"types": "./dist/aihio.d.ts"` to `package.json` exports
- [x] Add a build test asserting generated types match a known snapshot for at least one component

## Phase 6 — Canonical prompt fragment

Curated guidance beats raw schemas for steering. Ship a tight system-prompt deliverable.

- [x] Author `dist/aihio.prompt.md` (~300 lines) — component inventory with one-line purpose, intent→component map, pattern inventory, hard rules flattened from counterExamples, token intent vocabulary
- [x] Script regenerates schema-derived sections on build; hand-written strategy sections stay manual
- [x] Expose as `./prompt` package export so `import prompt from 'aihio/prompt'` works

## Phase 7 — Counter-examples & a11y contracts surfacing

Content pass that rides on Phases 1 + 4.

- [x] Fill in `counterExamples` + `a11yContract` on every component (seeded in Phase 1; revisit after patterns are authored)
- [x] Phase 4 warnings also fire on a11yContract violations
- [x] Prompt fragment (Phase 6) auto-includes counter-examples

## Phase 8 — Validator + MCP server (deferred)

Explicitly later. When it lands, reuses Phase 1's schema format, Phase 3's patterns, and Phase 7's rules with zero rework.

- [x] `aihio-lint` — takes HTML, returns structured errors against the schema
- [ ] MCP server exposing `describe(component)` + `lint(markup)` over stdio
- [ ] Test suite of known-bad markup snippets the linter must catch

## Sequencing notes

- Phase 1 is the keystone. Everything else depends on its format.
- Phases 2, 3, 5 are independent and can parallelize.
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 1.
- Phase 6 is last because it aggregates everything else.
- Phase 7 rides on Phase 1's format + Phase 4's warning infrastructure.
- Phase 8 is out of scope until earlier phases stabilize.
