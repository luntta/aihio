# Aihio

Aihio is a minimalistic user interface design system and web component library with user experience, accessibility and easy customization in mind.

Aihio is framework agnostic, so you can use it with whatever framework of your choosing (React, Vue, Polymer, litElement etc.) or none at all. It is taking advantage of latest web technologies, such as web components, modules etc., so it requires users to have a modern browser.
